/**CLUSTERSETCPP This class overloads the [] operator such that an instance
 *               A can access item c in cluster r using the notation
 *               A[c][r].
 * 
 * The elements of the clusters are held in thearray clusterEls. The offset
 * of the beginning of cluster c is given by offsetArray[c]. The size of
 * cluster c is given by clusterSizes[c]. the number of clusters and the
 * total number of elements are given by numClust and totalNumEl.
 *
 * If the initWithClusterSizes method is used to allocate space for the
 * class, then the allocated memory is freed when the destructor is called.
 * One can also explicitely set the elements of the class to one's own
 * buffers, and never call initWithClusterSizes, in which case the
 * destructor does not free the memory.
 *
 * The entire class is implemented in the header file.
