function points=Cart2Ellipse(cartPoints,a,f)
%%CART2ELLIPSE Convert Cartesian coordinates to ellipsoidal coordinates.
%
%INPUTS: cartPoints A matrix of the points in ECEF Cartesian coordinates
%                   that are to be transformed into ellipsoidal
%                   coordinates. Each column of cartPoints is of the
%                   format [x;y;z].
%           a       The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                   this argument is omitted, the value in
%                   Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%           f       The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                   this argument is omitted, the value in
%                   Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%
%OUTPUTS:   points  A matrix of the converted points. Each column of the
%                   matrix has the format [latitude;longitude;altitude],
%                   with latitude and longitude given in radians.
%
%The primary algorithm implemented in this function is
%I. Sofair "Improved method for calculating exact geodetic latitude and
%altitude revisited," Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, vol. 23,
%no. 2, p. 369, Mar. 2000.
%which is a modified version of the algorithm in
%I. Sofair, "Improved method for calculating exact geodetic latitude and
%altitude," Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, vol. 20, no. 4,
%pp. 824-826, Jul.-Aug. 1997.
%However, both techniques cited above will fail if the point in question
%is too close to the origin (deep within the Earth). In such an instance,
%Halley's method as described in
%Fukushima, T., "Transformation from Cartesian to geodetic coordinates
%accelerated by Halley's method", J.Geodesy (2006) 79: 689-693.
%is used instead, with a minor modification. If one lets the algorithm run
%for an arbitrary number of iterations, there will generally be underflows,
%since the ratio of S and C matter, but both terms can drift by a constant
%factor during the iterations. Thus, after each iterative step, the values
%are normalized so that C=1 (it takes one division). Convergence of
%Fukushima's method is assumed to occur after six iterations.
