function points=spher2Ellipse(points,a,f)
%%SPHER2CART  Convert points from spherical coordinates to ellipsoidal
%             coordinates. The spherical coordinates can either be full
%             coordinates [range;azimuth; elevation] or just pairs of 
%             [azimuth; elevation] or just [elevation] in which case it is
%             assumed that the points are on the surface of the reference
%             ellipsoid and one just has to convert the elevation
%             (spherical latitude) from geocentric to geodetic.
%
%INPUTS:  points  One or more points given in terms of range, azimuth and
%                 elevation, with the angles in radians. To convert
%                 N points, points is a 3XN matrix with each column
%                 having the format [range;azimuth; elevation].
%                 Alternatively, the points can be given just as [azimuth;
%                 elevation] pairs or just as elevations (geocentric
%                 latitudes). In such an instance, the elevations are
%                 converted to geodetic (ellipsoidal) latitudes for points
%                 located on the surface of the reference ellipsoid.
%           a     The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                 this argument is omitted, the value in
%                 Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%           f     The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                 this argument is omitted, the value in
%                 Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%
%OUTPUTS:   points  A matrix of the converted points. Each column of the
%                   matrix has the format [latitude;longitude;altitude] or
%                   [latitude;longitude] ot just latitude, respectively
%                   depending on the dimensionality of the input. The
%                   angles are given in radians.
%
%Azimuth is an angle measured from the x-axis in the x-y plane. Elevation
%is the angle above the x-y plane. The formula for directly converting
%between geocentric and geodetic latitudes is described in "An Overview of
%Major Terrestrial, Celestial, and Temporal Coordinate Systems for Target
%Tracking" by David F. Crouse.
