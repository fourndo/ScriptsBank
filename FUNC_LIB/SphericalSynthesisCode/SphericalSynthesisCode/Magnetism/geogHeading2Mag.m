function PEastOfNorth=geogHeading2Mag(points, geoEastOfNorth,year,a,f)
%GEOGHEADING2MAG Convert a heading in terms of radians clockwise (East)
%                from GEOGRAPHIC North to a heading in terms of radians
%                clockwise of MAGNETIC North as defined on a particular
%                reference ellipsoid. The WMM2010 model for the Earth's
%                magnetic field is used. In the rare spots (i.e. near the
%                magnetic poles), where the magnetic field vector points
%                directly towards the reference ellipsoid, the geographic
%                heading will be undefined and a NaN will be returned.
%
%INPUTS: points  One or more points given in geodetic latitude and
%                longitude, in radians, and height, in meters where the
%                geographic headings apply. To convert N headings, points is
%                a 3XN matrix with each column having the format
%                [latitude;longitude; height]. All points should be
%                associated with the same time. At the geographic poles,
%                the longitude value determines the orientation of the
%                local coordinate system axes. Thus, geographic headings
%                ARE defined at the poles.
%geoEastOfNorth  An NX1 array of N geographic headings in radians
%                clockwise from North that should be turned into magnetic
%                headings.
%    year        A decimal number indicating a year in the Gregorian
%                calendar as specified by UTC. For example, halfway through
%                the year 2012 would be represented as 2012.5. The
%                precision of the model is not sufficiently fine that leap
%                seconds matter. If this parameter is omitted, then the
%                last reference epoch of the geomagnetic model is used.
%           a    The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                this argument is omitted, the value in
%                Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%           f    The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                this argument is omitted, the value in
%                Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%
%OUTPUT: GeoEastOfNorth The headings converted to radians clockwise of
%                       magnetic North on the reference ellipse.
%
%The magnetic flux vector points to magnetic North. One finds the angle
%between geographic North and the projection of the negative magnetic flux
%vector in the local tangent plane. That angle subtracted from the
%geographic heading gives the magnetic heading.
%
%The consistency of the magnetic heading conversion routines can be
%validated using
%
% pointEllips=[40*pi/180;170*pi/180;30];
% geoEastOfNorth=64*pi/180;
% year=2014.0;
% geoEastOfNorthConv=geogHeading2Mag(pointEllips,magHeading2Geog(pointEllips,geoEastOfNorth,year));
% abs(geoEastOfNorthConv-geoEastOfNorth)
%
%If everything is consistent, then abs(geoEastOfNorthConv-geoEastOfNorth)
%should be zero.
%
%This function makes use of the functions getWMM2010Coeffs and 
%spherHarmonicEval to determine the magnetic flux vector at the specified
%points as well as the function getENUAxes to determine the local
%East-North-Up coordinate axes.
