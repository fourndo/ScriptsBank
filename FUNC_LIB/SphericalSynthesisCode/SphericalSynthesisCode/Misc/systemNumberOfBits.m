function numBits=systemNumberOfBits()
%%SYSTEMNUMBEROFBITS Return the number of bits of the system. For example,
%                    a 32-bit or 64-bit system.
%
%INPUTS:  None
%
%OUTPUTS: numBits   The number of bits of the system. This will typically
%                   be 32 or 64 bits.
%
%This function just uses the fact that the last two characters of the file
%extension of a mex file are the number of bits of the system. If systems
%with more bits arise, for example 128-bit computers, then this function
%will not properly report the number of bits as it only looks at the last
%two characters.
