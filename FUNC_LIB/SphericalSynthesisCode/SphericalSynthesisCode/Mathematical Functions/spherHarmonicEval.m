function [V,gradV]=spherHarmonicEval(C,S,point,a,c,fullyNormalized,scalFactor)
%%SPHERHARMONICEVAL  Evaluate a potential (e.g. gravitational or magnetic)
%                    and/ or the gradient of a potential when the
%                    potential is expressed in terms of spherical harmonic
%                    coefficients at a particular point given in spherical
%                    Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed coordinates. Alternatively,
%                    this function can be used to evaluate the type of
%                    spherical harmonic series used to express terrain
%                    heights when given just spherical azimuth and
%                    elevation (but no range).
%
%INPUTS:    C   A ClusterSet class holding the coefficient terms that are
%               multiplied by cosines in the harmonic expansion. C(n+1,m+1)
%               is the coefficient of degree n and order m. When a maximum
%               degree of M is used, all C must have values for all n
%               from 0 to M and for all m from 0 to n for each n. If
%               coefficients are not present for certain degrees, then
%               insert a 0. It is assumed that M>=3. For magnetic field
%               models, the units of C should generally be Tesla. For
%               gravitational models, C is generally unitless with the
%               units being determined entirely by the parameters a and c.
%           S   A ClusterSet class holding the coefficient terms that are
%               multiplied by sines in the harmonic expansion. The
%               requirements on S are the same as those on C.
%       point   The 3XN set of N points at which the potential and/or
%               gradient should be evaluated given in SPHERICAL, ECEF 
%               coordinates consisting of [r;azimuth;elevation]; When
%               evaluating points on a grid, the algorithm will be fastest
%               if the points are provided presorted by range and then by
%               azimuth. This reduces the amount of recomputation of
%               certain values. Alternatively, if C and S are for
%               evaluating terrain heights, then points are 2XN having the
%               format [azimuth;elevation] and it is best if the points are
%               sorted by azimuth.
%           a   The numerator in the (a/r)^n term in the spherical harmonic
%               sum. Normally, this is some type of a reference radius. For
%               example, when using most gravitational models, a is the
%               semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If this
%               parameter is omitted, it is assumed that one is using the
%               spherical harmonics with the World Magnetic Model 2010 and
%               the appropriate value is used. Alternatively, when point is
%               2D for a terrain height, this parameter is ignored (not
%               necessary) and an empty matrix can just be passed.
%           c   The constant value by which the spherical harmonic series
%               is multiplied. For example, for gravitational potentials,
%               the value is usually GM where G is the universal
%               gravitational constant and  M is the mass of the Earth.
%               If this parameter is omitted, it is assumed that one is
%               using the spherical harmonics with the World Magnetic Model
%               2010 and the appropriate value is used. Alternatively, when
%               point is 2D for a terrain height, this parameter is ignored
%               (not necessary) and an empty matrix can just be passed.
%fullyNormalized A boolean variable indicating whether the coefficients are
%               fully normalized. If false, then it is assumed that the
%               coefficients are Schmidt semi-normalized. If this parameter
%               is omitted, the default is true. The text below describes
%               the normalization. It is suggested that the coefficients be
%               normalized prior to passing them to this function as the
%               renormalization can be slow and can consume a lot of
%               memory.
%    scalFactor An optional scale factor used in computing the normalized
%               associated Legendre polynomials if fullyNormalized=true.
%               Generally, the default value (is if the scalFactor
%               parameter is omitted) of 10^(-280) that is suggested
%               in the Holmes and Featherstone paper (cited below) is
%               sufficient. When very high-order models are used, this
%               scale factor prevents overflows.
%
%OUTPUTS:  V    The potential as obtained from the spherical harmonic
%               series. When dealing with gravitational models, the SI
%               units are m^2/s^2, when dealing with geomagnetic models,
%               the SI units are T*m.
%      gradV    The  gradient of the potential in Cartesian coordinates as
%               obtained using the spherical harmonic series. If V is a
%               magnetic potential, then gradV is the negative of the
%               magnetic flux density vector B.
%
%When non-normalized coefficients are used, the spherical harmonic series
%for the potential is assumed to be of the form
%V=(c/r)*sum_{n=0}^M\sum_{m=0}^n(a/r)^n*(C(n+1,m+1)*cos(m*lambda)+S(n+1,m+1)*sin(m*lambda))*P^m_n(sin(theta))
%where r, lambda, and theta are the range, azimuth and elevation in a
%spherical coordinate system and P^m_n(x) is the notation for an associated
%Legendre function of degree n and order m evaluated at the point x. Note
%that theta is essentially a latitude, not a co-latitude, as is commonly
%used in an alternate definition of spherical coordinates. When computing
%terrain heights, which are specified only by spherical latitude and
%longitude, the (c/r) term as well as the (a/r) term disappear. When fully
%normalized coefficients are used (fullyNormalized=true), then P^m_n(x) is
%replaced with fully normalized associated Legendre functions
%\bar{P}_{nm}(x) and when Schmidt semi-normalized coefficients are used
%(fullyNormalized=false), then P^m_n(x) is replaced with S^m_n(x), the
%Schmidt semi-normalized legendre functions. This function does not
%explicitly handle coefficients that have no normalization, as they are
%not commonly used in practice.
%
%Note that models will often separate out the n=0 term, since
%sin(0*lambda)=0, cos(0*lambda)=1 and P^0_0(x)=1 and \bar{P}_{00}(x)=1 for
%any x. In such an instance, a C(0+1,0+1) might need to be explicitly
%added. For example, when using the coefficients for the EGM96 and EGM2008
%gravitational models provided by the National Geospatial Intelligence
%Agency (NGA), one has to insert C(0+1,0+1)=1.
%
%To understand the type of spherical harmonics that need to be inputted,
%one must disambiguate the different types of associated Legendre functions
%that can be used in the series.
%
%With the notation P^m_n(x) for an associated Legendre function of degree n
%and order m evaluated at the point x, one generally means 
%P^m_n(x)=(-1)^m*(1-x^2)^(m/2)*D_m{P_n(x)}
%where P_n(x) is a Legendre polynomial of degree n evaluated at x and
%D_m{P_n(x)} is the mth derivative of the polynomial. These associated
%Legendre functions are the same as those used in the International
%Geomagnetic Reference Field. On the other hand, with the notation
%P_{nm}(x), one generally means (-1)^mP^m_n(x). This notation is also
%called an associated Legendre function. Matlab's built-in function
%legendre(n,x) returns all P^m_n(x) for m=0 to m=n. On the other hand, the
%notation \bar{P}_{nm}(x), refers to a fully normalized associated Legendre
%function. Multiple definitions of what is normalized exist. In this
%function, the normalization is such that
%\bar{P}_{nm}(x)=P_{nm}(x)*sqrt(k*(2*n+1)*factorial(n-m)/factorial(n+m))
%where k=1 if m=0 and k=2 otherwise. This differs from the normalization
%constant that Matlab uses in the normalized version of its built-in
%associated Legendre function. It is the same as the normalization 
%constant the the NGA uses in its coefficients for the EGM96 and the
%EGM2008 gravitation models. When considering Schmidt semi-normalized
%associated Legednre functions, the relation is 
%S^m_n(x)=P_{nm}(x)*sqrt(2*factorial(n-m)/factorial(n+m))*(-1)^m
%Fully normalized associated Legendre functions are most commonly used with
%geomagnetic models. Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre functions
%are most commonly used with geomagnetic models.
%
%When spherical harmonic potentials and gradients are desired to a high
%degree and order, one can easily run into the limitations of double
%precision floating point numbers. For that reason, spherical harmonic
%series are often expressed in terms of fully normalized associated
%Legendre functions, rather than the standard Legendre functions that are
%more commonly used in textbooks. However, when the degree and order
%become very large, one can no longer directly compute even the fully
%normalized associated Legendre functions at all points, due to precision
%limitations. This means that one can not simply use the built-in
%legendre function in Matlab to obtain the polynomials. Consequently, when
%fully normalized coefficients are passed, the modified forward row (MFR)
%algorithm of 
%S. A. Holmes and W. E. Featherstone, "A unified approach to the Clenshaw
%summation and the recursive computation of very high degree and
%order normalised associated Legendre functions," Journal of Geodesy,
%vol. 76, no. 5, pp. 279-299, May 2002.
%is used in this function to avoid precision problems. Note that the
%notation of the normalized Legendre functions in the above paper is
%slightly different than that used here. First, the paper uses a
%colatitude (Let's call it \tilde{\theta}), not a latitude theta
%(elevation) in its spherical coordinate system. Thus, the sine term for
%the fully normalized associated Legendre function in the
%sum becomes a cosine term. That is, \bar{P}_{nm}(cos(\tilde{\theta})).
%However, the paper abbreviates the notation and does not explicitely write
%the cosine operator Thus, one might be led to erroneously believe that the
%paper is evaluating \bar{P}_{nm}(\tilde{\theta}).
%
%The Holmes and Featherstone algorithm can not be used for computing the
%acceleration due to gravity near the poles, because of singularities in
%the derivatives of spherical coordinates. Thus, the method of Pines, as
%expressed using fully-normalized Helmholtz polynomials as described in
%E. Fantino and S. Casotto, "Methods of harmonic synthesis for global
%geopotential models and their first-, second- and third-order gradients,"
%Journal of Geodesy, vol. 83, no. 7, pp. 595-619, Jul. 2009.
%is used instead when the latitude is within 2 degrees of the pole and the
%user wants gradV.
%
%On the other hand, when Schmidt-normalized coefficients are used, the
%coefficients are first converted to coefficients for fully-normalized
%associated Legendre functions. Note that the passed C and S values are
%duplicated and not modified during the conversion.
%
